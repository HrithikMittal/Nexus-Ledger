<h1>What is a Journal?</h1>
<h3>In accounting and bookkeeping, a journal is a record of financial transactions in order by date. 
Traditionally, a journal has been defined as the book of original entry. The definition was more appropriate when transactions were
written in a journal prior to manually posting them to the accounts in the general ledger or subsidiary ledger.</h4>
